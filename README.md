# Global Estimate of Mesopelagic Mesozooplankton BiomassðŸª¼

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data used for the analysis and visualization of global mesopelagic mesozooplankton biomass (MMB). The study investigates the relationship between MMB and environmental predictors, including particulate organic carbon (POC) and net primary production (NPP). It also explores the correlation between mesozooplankton diversity, species richness, range-size rarity, and biomass in the mesopelagic zone. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive global estimate of MMB and understand the ecological dynamics influencing mesozooplankton distribution and biomass

#### Restore the Environment ðŸ“¦

If you need to set up the environment on a different machine or restore it to a previous state, use the restore function:
```r
renv::restore()
```
